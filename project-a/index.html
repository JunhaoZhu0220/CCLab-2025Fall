                <p>Discovered in energy-rich Dark-Energy Voids. They exhibit stable life signs within a laboratory environment and appear most active against a dark environment.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>This creature exists in two distinct forms:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Singularis Form: Exists as two independent individuals, known as the "Positive" and the "Negative". Each individual is a spherical body with a large, single eye.</li>
                        <li>The two individuals lock together, forming a stable bipolar structure. In this form, their center emits a energy aura. The aura shifts from a dim glow to an intense magenta. This aura can also generate thunder...</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3 class="green">Key Characteristics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Attract each other like a magnet.</li>
                    <li>Like to absorb yellow charges.</li>
                    <li>Extremely dangerous when charging.</li>
                    <li>Seem to be sensitive to red charges.</li>
                    <li>Its power may decay.</li>

                The discovery of Magemite was purely accidental. Doctor Zhu first recorded this peculiar energy-based lifeform in 2033 during the 'VoidSim' project. Initially, only single individuals (either red or blue) were generated in the simulator. They appeared lifeless. <br>
                The breakthrough occurred during a dual-instantiation test: When a 'Positive' and a 'Negative' individual were introduced into the simulation simultaneously, they immediately displayed a strong mutual attraction and quickly combined into a stable, humming form. <br>
                Further observations revealed that different types of charges may trigger distinct behaviors. <br>
                <br>
                <span class="yellow"> Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span><br>
                Press two different place on the canvas to create two different Magnemites. They will be attracted to each other due to their magnetic field. The unified creature will follow the mouse cursor. Drag around to see what will happen...?
